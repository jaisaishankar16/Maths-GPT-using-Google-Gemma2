**Problem Statement**
----------------

The problem statement for this project is to develop a text-to-math problem solver and data search assistant using Google Gemma 2. The assistant should be able to answer math-related questions, provide detailed explanations, and display the solution point-wise. Additionally, it should be able to search the internet for information on various topics and provide relevant data.

**Dependencies and Requirements**
-------------------------------

To run this project, you will need to install the following dependencies:

* `streamlit` for building the web application
* `langchain_groq` for interacting with the Google Gemma 2 API
* `langchain` for building the language models and prompts
* `wikipedia-api` for searching the internet for information
* `streamlit_callback_handler` for handling callbacks in the Streamlit application

You will also need to obtain a Groq API key from Google Gemma 2 and add it to the `app.py` file.

**Code Walkthrough**
----------------

The code is structured into several sections:

1. **Streamlit App Setup**: The first section sets up the Streamlit app with a title, page title, and page icon.
2. **Groq API Key Input**: The second section prompts the user to enter their Groq API key, which is required for interacting with the Google Gemma 2 API.
3. **LLM Model Initialization**: The third section initializes the LLM model using the Groq API key.
4. **Tool Initialization**: The fourth section initializes several tools, including a Wikipedia search tool, a math calculator tool, and a reasoning tool.
5. **Chain Initialization**: The fifth section combines the tools into a chain, which is used to generate responses to user input.
6. **Agent Initialization**: The sixth section initializes the agent, which uses the chain to generate responses to user input.
7. **Interaction**: The seventh section sets up the interaction between the user and the agent, including a text area for inputting questions and a button to generate responses.

**Ideology**
------------

The ideology behind this project is to develop a chatbot that can answer math-related questions and provide detailed explanations. The chatbot uses the Google Gemma 2 API to generate responses, and it combines several tools to provide a comprehensive solution to user queries.

**Solution**
------------

The solution achieved by this project is a text-to-math problem solver and data search assistant that can answer math-related questions and provide relevant data. The chatbot uses the Google Gemma 2 API to generate responses, and it combines several tools to provide a comprehensive solution to user queries. The chatbot is designed to be user-friendly and interactive, with a text area for inputting questions and a button to generate responses.
