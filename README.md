**Problem Statement**
================

The project aims to develop a text-to-math problem solver and data search assistant using Google Gemma 2 and LangChain. The app is designed to assist users in solving mathematical problems and provide detailed explanations for the solutions. Additionally, the app can be used to search for information on various topics using Wikipedia.

**Dependencies and Requirements**
===============================

* Python 3.9 or higher
* Streamlit
* LangChain
* LangChain-Groq
* WikipediaAPIWrapper
* LLMMathChain
* LLMChain
* PromptTemplate
* AgentType
* Tool

**Commands to Download Requirements**
=====================================

1. Install Python 3.9 or higher
2. Install Streamlit using `pip install streamlit`
3. Install LangChain using `pip install langchain`
4. Install LangChain-Groq using `pip install langchain-groq`
5. Install WikipediaAPIWrapper using `pip install langchain-community`
6. Install LLMMathChain and LLMChain using `pip install langchain`

**Code Walkthrough**
================

The code is divided into several sections:

1. **Setting up the Streamlit App**: The Streamlit app is set up with a title and a page icon.
2. **Initializing the Groq API**: The Groq API is initialized with a text input field for the API key.
3. **Initializing the Tools**: Two tools, Wikipedia and Calculator, are initialized using WikipediaAPIWrapper and LLMMathChain respectively.
4. **Initializing the Math Tool**: The Math tool is initialized using LLMMathChain and a prompt template is created for math-related questions.
5. **Combining the Tools into a Chain**: The Wikipedia, Calculator, and Math tools are combined into a chain using LLMChain.
6. **Initializing the Agent**: The agent is initialized with the combined tools and the Groq API.
7. **Interaction**: The user can enter a question and click the "Find my answer" button to generate a response.

**Ideology and Solution**
=====================

The code uses LangChain to create a chain of tools that can be used to answer math-related questions. The chain consists of three tools: Wikipedia, Calculator, and Math. The Wikipedia tool is used to search for information on various topics, the Calculator tool is used to answer math-related questions, and the Math tool is used to generate a detailed explanation for the solution.

The agent is initialized with the combined tools and the Groq API, and is used to generate a response for the user's question. The response includes a detailed explanation for the solution, and is displayed in a chat-like interface.

**Theoretical Explanation**
=====================

The code uses the following concepts:

* LangChain: A Python library that allows you to create chains of tools that can be used to answer questions.
* LLMChain: A class in LangChain that allows you to create a chain of tools.
* LLMMathChain: A class in LangChain that allows you to create a math-related tool.
* WikipediaAPIWrapper: A class that allows you to search for information on various topics using Wikipedia.
* PromptTemplate: A class that allows you to create a template for a prompt.
* AgentType: A class that allows you to specify the type of agent to use.
* Tool: A class that allows you to create a tool that can be used in the chain.

**Final Command to Run the Program**
=====================================

1. Run the following command in your terminal: `streamlit run app.py`
2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`
3. Enter a question in the text area and click the "Find my answer" button to generate a response.
